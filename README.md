## Hi, I'm Amadi Chiemelumogo â€“ Data Analyst | On-chain Analyst | Insight Explorer | Storyteller with Data

I'm a passionate and detail-oriented Analyst with a strong drive to uncover insights that fuel smarter decisions. I've immersed myself in data analyticsâ€”with hands-on real-world projects, capstone challenges, and weekly analytical tasks. My approach combines curiosity, technical skills, and business understanding to solve problems that matter.

I thrive on transforming raw data into clean, structured, and meaningful insights.

Tools I use regularly:
- **SQL** (PostgreSQL, SQL Server)
- **Excel** (advanced formulas, pivot tables, dashboards)
- **Power BI & Tableau**
- **Python** (beginner)

I'm constantly learning and applying new techniques to better understand how data can drive performance, especially in business, finance, and social impact contexts.
